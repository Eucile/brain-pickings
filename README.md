# Brain Pickings

#### a site clone by Krystal Foster
#### Oct. 19, 2018

### Description

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.
It will be launched on firebase as a site clone of the famous online newsletter, using TypeScript, angular components and any new tools I uncover in the weeks ahead.   

## Blue Print

1. The program will feature a main article section that will be informed by a TypeScript model.

2. The program will feature a sidebar that will contain multiple components.

3. The first component in the sidebar will be a donation section. It does not change or require a constructor, so it will likely be hard-coded and styled within its own component.

4. The second component contains two newsletter forms. Again, these do not update with new information so they will be hard-coded and composed in their own component.

5. The third component in the sidebar is an About and Contact section. These will only provide so will follow suit with the previous components blue print.

6. The fourth sidebar component is an "Also" section that directs users to other resources on the website.

7. The fifth component is an archive section that will include a search feature. I don't have access to the database and have no idea currently how to implement this part entirely.

8. The sixth sidebar component is a "Favorite Reads" section. This is also a static list that previews
