# Brain Pickings

#### a site clone by Krystal Foster

### Description

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.
It will be launched on firebase as a landing-page clone of the online newsletter, [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/) using TypeScript, angular components and any new tools I uncover in the weeks ahead.   

## Blue Print

1. The program will feature a main article section that will be informed by a TypeScript model.

2. The program will feature a sidebar that will contain multiple components.

3. The first component in the sidebar will be a donation section. It does not change or require a constructor, so it will likely be hard-coded and styled within its own component.

4. The second component contains two newsletter forms. Again, these do not update with new information so they will be hard-coded and composed in their own space.

5. The third component in the sidebar is an About and Contact section. These will only provide hyperlinks so will be managed like the above sections.

6. The fourth sidebar component is an "Also" section that directs users to other additional media on the website.

7. The fifth component is an archive section that will include a search feature. I don't have access to the database and have no idea currently how to implement this part but it will be styled and composed in its own component as though it works.

8. The sixth sidebar component is a "Favorite Reads" section. This is also a static list that previews the most popular articles up-to-date.

9. "Labours of Love" is the ninth component that will feature hand-drawn charts and references to a selection of more articles chosen by the owner.

10. Another component is the logo banner at the top. This contains animation and styling that I will explore in the future.

11. The last component will comprise the footer section. It will be hard-coded and arranged as needed.
