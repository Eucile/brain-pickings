    <h1><a href="">A Brave and Startling Truth: Astrophysicist Janna Levin Reads Maya Angelou’s Stunning Humanist Poem That Flew to Space, Inspired by Carl Sagan</a></h1>

        <p>Angelou composed the poem for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in 1995. In 1994, Carl Sagan delivered a beautiful speech at Cornell University, inspired by the <em>Voyager</em>’s <a  href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/14/happy-birthday-pale-blue-dot/">landmark photograph</a> of Earth seen for the very first time from the outer reaches of the Solar System — a now-iconic image the spacecraft took on Sagan’s spontaneous insistence before shutting off the cameras upon completion of the planned mission to photograph the outer planets. </p>

<p>In describing what the <em>Voyager</em> captured in that grainy photograph of mostly empty space, Sagan limned Earth as a “pale blue dot.” That became the moniker of the photograph itself and the title of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345376595/braipick-20" target="_blank">bestselling book</a> published later that year, in which he wrote that “everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives” on this <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/12/10/pale-blue-dot-motion-graphics/">“mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.”</a></p>
<p>This poetic phrase imprinted itself on the popular imagination and permeated culture in the months following the book’s publication — the months during which Angelou was composing her poem. Like all great poets, she was extremely precise and deliberate about her word choice. <em>Mote</em> is a rather peculiar word, particularly in this cosmic context, and I can’t help but think that by using the phrase “mote of matter” in the final stanzas, Angelou was paying tribute to Sagan and to the message of the <em>Voyager</em> — a message about our place in the cosmic order not as something separate from and superior to nature, but as a tiny pixel-part of it, imbued with equal parts humility and responsibility. </p>
<p>Reading the poem at <em>The Universe in Verse</em> is astrophysicist <strong>Janna Levin</strong> — a recent <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/04/23/ursula-k-le-guin-hymn-to-time-janna-levin/">performer of some beautiful poetry</a> and a member, alongside Sagan, of the tiny peer group of working scientists who write about science <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/25/black-hole-blues-janna-levin-joseph-weber/">with  uncommon poetic might</a>.

<blockquote><p><strong class="brave-poem">A BRAVE AND STARTLING TRUTH</strong></p>
<p><img id="yellow-quotes" src="assets/yellow-quote.png">We, this people, on a small and lonely planet<br>
Traveling through casual space<br>
Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns<br>
To a destination where all signs tell us<br>
It is possible and imperative that we learn<br>
A brave and startling truth </p>
<p>And when we come to it<br>
To the day of peacemaking<br>
When we release our fingers<br>
From fists of hostility<br>
And allow the pure air to cool our palms </p>
<p>When we come to it<br>
When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate<br>
And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean<br>
When battlefields and coliseum<br>
No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters<br>
Up with the bruised and bloody grass<br>
To lie in identical plots in foreign soil </p>
<p>When the rapacious storming of the churches<br>
The screaming racket in the temples have ceased<br>
When the pennants are waving gaily<br>
When the banners of the world tremble<br>
Stoutly in the good, clean breeze </p>
<p>When we come to it<br>
When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders<br>
And children dress their dolls in flags of truce<br>
When land mines of death have been removed<br>
And the aged can walk into evenings of peace<br>
When religious ritual is not perfumed<br>
By the incense of burning flesh<br>
And childhood dreams are not kicked awake<br>
By nightmares of abuse </p>
<p>When we come to it<br>
Then we will confess that not the Pyramids<br>
With their stones set in mysterious perfection<br>
Nor the Gardens of Babylon<br>
Hanging as eternal beauty<br>
In our collective memory<br>
Not the Grand Canyon<br>
Kindled into delicious color<br>
By Western sunsets </p>
<p>Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe<br>
Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji<br>
Stretching to the Rising Sun<br>
Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who, without favor,<br>
Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores<br>
These are not the only wonders of the world </p>
<p>When we come to it<br>
We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe<br>
Who reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger<br>
Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace<br>
We, this people on this mote of matter<br>
In whose mouths abide cankerous words<br>
Which challenge our very existence<br>
Yet out of those same mouths<br>
Come songs of such exquisite sweetness<br>
That the heart falters in its labor<br>
And the body is quieted into awe </p>
<p>We, this people, on this small and drifting planet<br>
Whose hands can strike with such abandon<br>
That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living<br>
Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness<br>
That the haughty neck is happy to bow<br>
And the proud back is glad to bend<br>
Out of such chaos, of such contradiction<br>
We learn that we are neither devils nor divines </p>
<p>When we come to it<br>
We, this people, on this wayward, floating body<br>
Created on this earth, of this earth<br>
Have the power to fashion for this earth<br>
A climate where every man and every woman<br>
Can live freely without sanctimonious piety<br>
Without crippling fear </p>
<p>When we come to it<br>
We must confess that we are the possible<br>
We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world<br>
That is when, and only when<br>
We come to it.</p></blockquote>
